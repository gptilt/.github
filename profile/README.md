## Our Mission

We believe in the power of data to unlock deeper insights into League of Legends gameplay.

We're committed to delivering:

- **High-Quality Datasets:** Curate, normalize, and enrich raw LoL data into formats specifically designed for efficient data analysis and machine learning workloads. All datasets will be open-code, most datasets will be FREE, a few will be monetized to help finance GPTilt.
- **Foundational Tools for Common Problems:** Create utility libraries and tools that simplify common needs when working with LoL data.
- **Community Collaboration:** Enable data scientists, analysts, and enthusiasts to easily access and utilize LoL data for their projects.
